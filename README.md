## About This Learning Project

This repository represents my practical journey through MLOps concepts and tools. Each module builds upon previous knowledge, creating a comprehensive understanding of machine learning operations in production environments.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **MLflow** - Experiment tracking and model registry
- **Docker** - Containerization and environment management
- **Mage AI** - Workflow orchestration
- **XGBoost & Scikit-learn** - Machine learning frameworks
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

### 📚 Learning Structure
Following the DataTalks.Club MLOps Zoomcamp curriculum, this project demonstrates practical implementation of MLOps principles through hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios using the NYC Taxi dataset.

## Learning Modules & Progress
